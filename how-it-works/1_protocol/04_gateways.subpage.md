## The BigFile Security Model: Inherited Trust, Mathematical Certainty

The security and integrity of the BigFile network are not an afterthought; they are the bedrock upon which our entire ecosystem is built. We achieve a fortress-like security posture by combining the unparalleled security of the Ethereum mainnet with the mathematical certainty of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. This document details the components of our Security & Data Layer.

### 1. The Settlement Layer: Ethereum as Our Ultimate Source of Truth

BigFile operates as a Layer 2 (L2) network, which means we don't create our own consensus or security from scratch. Instead, we **inherit the security of Ethereum**.

* **How it Works:** All transactions on the BigFile L2 are bundled into batches. The validity of each batch is proven by a single ZK-proof, which is then submitted to our Verifier smart contract on the Ethereum L1. Once Ethereum accepts this proof, the state of our L2 becomes final and immutable, benefiting from the full economic security of Ethereum's vast network of validators.
* **Why it Matters:** This approach provides the best of both worlds: the low fees and high throughput of our L2, combined with the gold-standard security of Ethereum. It means an attacker would have to attack Ethereum itself to compromise the integrity of the BigFile network—a near-impossible feat.

### 2. The Integrity Layer: ZK-Proofs as a Guarantee of Correctness

While Ethereum secures the *history* of our L2, ZK-proofs secure the *correctness* of every operation within it. This is the core of our "verifiable" promise.

* **Proof-of-Storage:** We don't just ask you to trust that a provider is storing your files. Our protocol periodically challenges providers to generate a ZK-proof demonstrating that they still possess the correct data fragments. This proof is verified on our L2, providing a constant, automated audit of the entire storage network's integrity.
* **Proof-of-Computation:** For our AI marketplace, ZK-proofs are a game-changer. When a user pays for a compute job, the GPU provider must generate a ZK-proof that they executed the correct AI model with the correct inputs. This eliminates any possibility of fraudulent or incorrect results, creating a truly trustless marketplace for computation.

### 3. The Data Availability Layer: Ensuring Transparency and Resilience

For a rollup to be secure, the data from its transactions must be made available to the public. This ensures that anyone can independently verify the state of the L2 and challenge the Sequencer if it acts maliciously.

* **How it Works:** The BigFile protocol posts a compressed version of all transaction data to a dedicated Data Availability (DA) layer. While this can be Ethereum itself, our modular architecture with the Polygon CDK also allows us to use specialized and more cost-effective DA layers like Celestia in the future.
* **Why it Matters:** Data Availability is the cornerstone of rollup security. It guarantees that the network remains transparent and that no single entity (not even the BigFile team) can censor users or manipulate the state without being detected and challenged. This ensures the network's long-term resilience and decentralization.

By combining these three layers—Ethereum for settlement, ZK-proofs for integrity, and a robust Data Availability solution—BigFile creates a multi-layered security model that is unparalleled in the DePIN space.
