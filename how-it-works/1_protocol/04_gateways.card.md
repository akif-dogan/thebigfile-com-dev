# Security & Data Layer

Our ZK-Rollup technology bundles the validity of thousands of transactions on our L2 into a single cryptographic proof (a ZK-proof). This proof is submitted to the Ethereum Mainnet for final, immutable security. This allows BigFile to combine the security of an L1 project with the speed and low cost of an L2.
