# Host Resilient dApps & Websites

Say goodbye to centralized servers and single points of failure. With BigFile's permanent storage layer, you can host your entire web application—from the frontend to the backend assets—directly on our decentralized network. This ensures your dApp or website is censorship-resistant, always available, and can be updated transparently via smart contract logic or DAO governance.
