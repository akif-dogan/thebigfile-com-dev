# Build Verifiable Data Economies

BigFile is more than infrastructure; it's a foundation for new economies. Imagine dynamic NFTs whose metadata is not only stored permanently but is also processed and updated by on-chain AI models. Create verifiable, decentralized scientific research platforms where datasets are stored securely and computations are proven mathematically. BigFile provides the tools to build the trusted data ecosystems of tomorrow.
