# Polygon CDK & ZK-Rollups

BigFile's scalability and security are powered by the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK), enabling us to deploy our own Layer 2 appchain. We utilize ZK-Rollup technology, which bundles thousands of off-chain transactions into a single, succinct cryptographic proof (a ZK-proof). This proof is then posted to the Ethereum mainnet. This architecture provides the best of both worlds: massive throughput and near-zero gas fees for our users, combined with the unparalleled, battle-tested security of Ethereum.
