# The AggLayer & True Interoperability

A fault-tolerant network is just the beginning. BigFile is designed to be a foundational layer for a unified Web3, not an isolated island. By connecting to Polygon's upcoming Aggregation Layer (AggLayer), we will enable near-instant, atomic swaps and shared liquidity with every other chain in the ecosystem. This means dApps on other networks can seamlessly access BigFile's storage and AI compute resources, creating a truly interconnected and liquid digital economy.
