# Architecture of the BigFile

BigFile is built on a pragmatic, two-phased architecture designed for immediate utility and long-term scalability.
*Phase 1 (The Foundation):* We begin on the robust and liquid Polygon PoS network. The BIG token is launched as a sophisticated, upgradeable ERC-20, allowing us to build a strong community and a stable economic base.

*Phase 2 (The Superstructure):* We will deploy the BigFile Chain, a dedicated Layer 2 ZK-Rollup built with the Polygon CDK. This appchain will handle all core protocol operations—storage contracts, AI compute jobs, and provider rewards—with near-zero gas fees and massive throughput, while inheriting the security of Ethereum.
