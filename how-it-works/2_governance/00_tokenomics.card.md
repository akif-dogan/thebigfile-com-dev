# BIG Token: Fueling a Decentralized Economy

The BIG token is the utility lifeblood of the BigFile ecosystem. It's an ERC-20 token on the Polygon network, designed with a sophisticated economic engine to reward holders and build a sustainable liquidity base. In the future BigFile L2, BIG will evolve into the native coin used for paying transaction fees (gas), staking to secure the network, and giving the community governance over the protocol's future.
