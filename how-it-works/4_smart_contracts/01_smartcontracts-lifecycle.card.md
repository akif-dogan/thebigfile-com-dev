# On-Demand AI & HPC Marketplace

BigFile creates a global, permissionless marketplace for computational power. Users can rent raw GPU resources—measured in metrics like TFLOPS or GHz—for any duration to train AI models, run scientific simulations, or perform complex rendering tasks. Payments are settled instantly in BIG tokens, which are then distributed to the providers powering the network. This is Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), rebuilt for the Web3 era.
